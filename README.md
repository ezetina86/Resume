# Enrique Zetina's Resume

This repository contains the LaTeX source for Enrique Zetina's resume.

## How to Compile

To generate the PDF of the resume, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system (e.g., [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS, [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux/Windows, or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows).

Once you have a LaTeX distribution installed, you can compile the resume by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pdflatex -jobname="Enrique_Zetina" resume.tex
```

This command will create the PDF with the filename `Enrique_Zetina.pdf`.

You may need to run the command twice to ensure all cross-references are correctly generated.
